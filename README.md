this code use an autoencoder approach to denoise STM images
You can find more detail in the PDF document
the trained model 'denoising-model-9 and denoising mode-11' are pretrained on Hf-doped ZrTe3 images but can give some decent results on other images from different samples, I tried it on 1T-TaS2 and TiSe2 with minor horizontal noise and resulted in okay denoised images.
